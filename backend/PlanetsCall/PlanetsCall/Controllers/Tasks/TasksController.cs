/*
 * Tasks are very important part of PlanetsCall project
 * Idea: users get scheduled tasks added earlier by admin or task from organisation (verified only, one per day, fixed reward)
 * Controller here is used to get those tasks and send verification video/photo of completing it
 * so users with higher level check of user complete task correctly or no
 *
 * 1 simple task per day and 1 harder task per week come from admin part
 * admins make templates and scheduled program pick one random every day/week
